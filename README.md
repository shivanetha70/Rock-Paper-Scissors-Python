# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Python
Here's a Python project about Rock, Paper, Scissors that uses adaptive artificial intelligence:
Rock, Paper & Scissor game made with PYTHON | PPT: This presentation from SIMRANPARDESHI illustrates the basic principle of adaptive artificial intelligence technology.

Here are some steps for writing a Python program for Rock, Paper, Scissors:
1.Import random options
2.Get user choice
3.Get computer choice
4.Print "You chose: ", user_choice
5.Print "Computer chose: ", computer_choice
6.If user_choice == computer_choice: print "It's a tie!"

Here are some rules for Rock, Paper, Scissors:
1.Rock is a closed fist
2.Paper is a flat hand with fingers and thumb extended and the palm facing downward
3.Scissors is a fist with the index and middle fingers fully extended toward the opposing player
